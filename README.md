# ML Project - RLHF

## Project Overview

This project explores the foundations of Transformers and the methodology of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The key goals of this project are to:

- Provide an introduction to Transformers, the foundational architecture of modern language models.
- Explain the concept and implementation of Causal Transformers, focusing on self-supervised learning and autoregressive mechanisms.
- Detail the RLHF framework, with a particular focus on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Reward Modeling.
- Provide references to academic papers, code repositories, and tutorials to support further exploration.
